Band Bio Content
Originally conceived as a solo project by Venomous to satisfy a longing need to create music, Lenax quickly evolved from a one-off endeavor into a full band driven by an infectious love for live performance. About 18 months after their first show and following two EPs, the band released their full-length debut "Infection."
Lenax's music conveys a drive towards individuality and free will, using occult and cosmic horror themes to explore deeper philosophical concepts beyond simple religious rebellion. Their sound pays homage to influences like Immortal, Enslaved, Watain, and Dark Funeral while establishing something entirely new in the realm of melodic black metal.
